# Twitter Wordcloud

This project consists of two programs. One continuously searches Twitter for tweets based on search terms provided and stores the found tweets in a csv format file. Search terms can be hashtags or specific words, the example files are called 'Reading_TweetList.txt' and 'VandB_TweetList.txt'. The other program produces a wordcloud based on the tweets stored within the file.
